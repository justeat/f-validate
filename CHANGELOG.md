v0.16.0
------------------------------
*March 26, 2018*

v0.14.0
------------------------------
*February 23, 2018*

### Added
- Comments added to each rule definition

### Fixed
- Fixed instances where the `email`, `minlength` and `maxlength` fields would validate as true when they shouldn't do
- Tests added for the above cases


v0.13.0
------------------------------
*February 23, 2018*

### Changed
- Have made it the default behaviour to set the `novalidate` attribute on a form when `f-validate` is initialised on it.  This can be overidden if the developer wants to allow the default HTML5 validation to kick in by setting the `enableHTML5Validation` option to true.
- Custom error attributes changed so that they are in the format `data-val-` as they weren't consistent.
- Updated some of the test descriptions on error messages to be a little clearer as to the expected functionality.  Re-jigged the ordering as well, so that the default rules come first.
- Snapshots updated with the above changes.


v0.12.0
------------------------------
*February 19, 2018*

### Fixed
- Fixed issue with `validateOn` marking form as valid when `blur` event fired due to validating child elements inside groups
- Readme typo

### Added
- Constant `validationGroup` added that defines the data-attribute for group validation elements

### Changed
- Pull request image updated
- Updated how validation groups get assigned.  Now uses the data-attribute `data-val-group` rather than the class `validation-group` as modules should use attributes for hook definitions.
- Some of the tests updated so that they are a bit clearer in their definition.  Stubbed date has changed to 2018 in the tests (as it was a bit confusing testing against a future date)


v0.11.0
------------------------------
